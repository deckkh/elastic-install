Introduction
=========

The scope of this repo is to provide a fully working Elasticsearch cluster out of the box, not just parts of it. Cluster will be fully deployed with security enabled and strong passwords. TLS is enabled as default. You can choose between several certificate providers such as Elastic or Easy RSA.

Deployed originally on Hyper-v , but not required.

Installation is based on Centos-8 stream images.
